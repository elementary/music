/**
 * This class makes setting the rating from a cell possible. Unlike the other widgets,
 * it only allows doing so by clicking over a star.
 *
 * When the rating changes by activating (i.e. clicking) the cell renderer, it doesn't re-draw itself
 * automatically and/or apply the new rating right away, since there could be client code wanting
 * to check the new value. Instead, it passes the responsability off to the rating_changed signal handler.
 * That signal handler *must* take care of setting the new rating on the proper cell, and only then
 * the new value will take effect.
